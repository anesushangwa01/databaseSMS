Node.js with Express (Backend Server):
Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. It allows you to build scalable web applications and APIs.
Express.js is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, handling HTTP requests, and creating middleware functions.
Routing: You define different routes in Express to handle HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with your data.


Testing with cURL:
cURL is a command-line tool used to send HTTP requests. It is an excellent tool for testing APIs because it allows you to quickly send requests from the terminal or command line.
